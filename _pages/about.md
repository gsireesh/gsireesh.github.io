I'm a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University's [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu), advised by
[Emma Strubell](https://strubell.github.io). I previously completed a masters degree here under the
supervision of [Carolyn Rose](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/), and a BA in computer science at
Columbia University. My work is supported by the Army Research Lab's
[HTMDEC](https://arl.devcom.army.mil/htmdec/) US Citizen Fellowship and Mozilla.

My research focuses on NLP and AI tools that allows users in specialized domains to keep agency in
their work. How can we empower people to customize and change their tools to reflect
and be useful to how they see their own jobs, rather than how their boss or a tech company with a
billion other users does? More concretely, I focus on user-customizable, on-device models that
live in the browser, and how to effectively reason their limitations and update them. I'm also interested in the incentives that
shape NLP research, whether funding, tooling, or culture.

Before coming to CMU, I spent six years in industry. I started at IBM Watson in 2015 on a team that
did bespoke prototypes; I then moved to [Kensho Technologies](https://kensho.com) in 2018, where I spent
three and a half years, first working as an ML engineer focused on NLP, then as the first lead of
the ML Ops and Internal Tools team.
