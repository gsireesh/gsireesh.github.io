I'm presenting two papers at ACL next month! an [interview study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12495) 
that characterizes the [sociotechnical gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03100) between what experts in materials science 
and law/policy do, and  and where NLP research is focused, and our
work on [Collage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23478), a tool for facilitating rapid prototyping, co-design,
and debugging of information extraction approaches on PDFs.
