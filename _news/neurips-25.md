I'm at NeurIPS this week, presenting our [work on data-driven materials design](/assets/pdf/gururaja_2025_datadrivendesign.pdf)
as a [dataset proposal](/assets/pdf/ddd_proposal.pdf). I also contributed to work at the [Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2025/110).
